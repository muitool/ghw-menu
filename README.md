## ghw-menu

Github Worlds menu is a visualization toolkit that provides
**Views** into JSON data that comes from the
[Github GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/).
It is called Github Worlds **menu** because there is also a
**[Github Worlds drawer](https://muitool.github.io/ghw-drawer/)** which displays the same data and views
but with the
**[Drawer](https://material-ui.com/demos/drawers/)**
being the primary navigation element instead of the
**[Menu](https://material-ui.com/demos/menus/)**
