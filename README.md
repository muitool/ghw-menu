## ghw-menu

Github Worlds menu is a visualization toolkit that provides
**Views** into JSON data that comes from the
[Github GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/).
It is called Github Worlds **menu** because there is also a
Github Worlds **drawer** which displays the same data and views
but with the
**[Drawer](https://material-ui.com/demos/drawers/)**
being the primary navigation element instead of the
**[Menu](https://material-ui.com/demos/menus/)**

This demo is an extension of
[mui-menu](https://github.com/stormasm/mui-tutorial-demo/tree/master/mui-menu) and it is assumed that you have already reviewed the concepts and
documentation associated with that repo.

### The Card Views

There are four views present in the Github Worlds drawer and menu demo series. They include in order of View appearance.

* Cards displayed six across in an infinite vertical column
* Cards displayed in a Horizontal Line
* Cards displayed as a function of
[react-autosuggest](https://github.com/moroshko/react-autosuggest)
in concert with
[Material-UI Tables](https://material-ui.com/demos/tables/)
* Cards displayed with no avatars

#### Code Details

The **Admin** functionality was removed from this repo
because it is not used or relevant; but it is
still used and relevant in
[mui-menu](https://github.com/stormasm/mui-tutorial-demo/tree/master/mui-menu#adding-dynamic-routes)
